# DynamicStamp

This is a Blender addon used to write dynamically note stamp on renders. This will change automatically note stamp, based on a csv file.

# How to use it

*  Open a csv file in Blender. First column must be frame number, second column must be your note stamp (separator is ';')
*  On DynamicStamp panel, choose your text data block (corresponding to csv file loaded)
*  Click on refresh icon to load/reload data
*  If you want to have a default note stamp when a frame is not in csv file, active placeholder option, and placeholder text
